# Bioinformatics & Machine Learning Engineer

I am a problem solver at the intersection of **Computer Science** and **Biotechnology**. Currently pursuing an MS in Bioinformatics at San Jose State University, I focus on building efficient computational tools and AI models to solve complex biological challenges.

- **MS in Bioinformatics** @ San Jose State University (In Progress, expect to graduate 2027 summer)
- **Dual BS** in Computer Science & Engineering and Horticultural Biotechnology
- **Hackathon Champion**: SJSU Bioinformatics Hackathon 2025 (RAG pipeline for SNPs), Sillicon Valley Koreans 
- **Background**: Former Android Developer with a focus on scalable architecture and Agile workflows.
